  Pickling allows you to serialize and de-serializing Python object structures. In short, Pickling is a way to convert a python object into a character stream
  so that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.
  Pickling:  pickling is a process where a python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream.
  Unpickling: unpickling is the inverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy.
